This project will designing, building, testing and critiquing a system for Performing face alignment and CNN will used to landmarks and find mouth, nose in the test image.   Introduction

There have few steps to build up this system. 
Step 1 : Convert the image to grayscale, the single channel will more easily to training. 
Step 2 : Save the training data (training image.npz) with csv , the image part will be the  
training images and the keypoint part will be the label. 
Step 3 : Build up a CNN with five layers to make the prediction more accurately. 
Step 4 : Build a model and training data for better accuracy rate. 
Step 5: Prediction the test image and save the data with csv. 
Step 6: Find the mouth, nose coordinates and change itâ€™s color.
